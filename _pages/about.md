My full name is Nguyen Thi Xuan Hong, you can call me Xuan Hong.
I am currently working as an Associate Management, considered a Key Talent at one of the largest joint-stock commercial banks in Vietnam - Techcombank.
For more detail regarding to this program: [please click here](https://tuyendung.techcombankjobs.com/techdata) to have more insight.
I surpassed over 2000 applicants to become one of the 14 talented candidates in the IT Division of Techcombank, rotating through various positions. In my first role as a Business Analyst, I participated in the Auto Earning project, which allowed customers' idle money to generate interest, leading Techcombank to the top position in CASA (Current Account and Savings Account) for the first time. This project was essentially an application of my previous research on asset allocation, aiming for high returns with low risk while accommodating the uncertainty of when customers would need their funds, ensuring no liquidity risk for the customers.

My major at Hanoi University of Science and Technology [(HUST)](https://hust.edu.vn/) is Mathematics â€“ Informatics. 
I have always been curious about Applied Mathematics, especially discrete and continuous Optimization.
During my university years, I focused on researching mathematical problems applied to economics. My thesis was regrading to bi-level optimization and its application in Economics. I deployed a MATLAB program to allocate investment assets among different stocks in the Vietnamese market.  Furthermore, I achieved the highest results in the Applied Mathematics Committee and became the only student at my cohort that year to present at the 21st Workshop on Optimization and Scientific Computing in 2023. Additionally, I had a two-month research internship at the Institute of Mathematics and Informatics, Vietnam Academic of Science and Technology (VAST) - the biggest governmental life science research institution in Vietnam. During those times, I worked on a collaborative problem involving multi-parties and different business growths, which led to significant results and then presented at the VAST annually conference.
