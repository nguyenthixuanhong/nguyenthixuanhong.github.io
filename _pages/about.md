<div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: justify;">

<p>My full name is <strong>Nguyen Thi Xuan Hong</strong>, you can call me <strong>Xuan Hong</strong>.</p>

<p>I am currently working as an <strong>Management Associate</strong>, considered a <strong>Key Talent</strong> at one of the largest joint-stock commercial banks in Vietnam – <strong>Techcombank</strong>.</p>

<p>For more detail regarding this program: <a href="https://tuyendung.techcombankjobs.com/techdata" target="_blank">please click here</a> to have more insight.</p>

<p>I surpassed over 2000 applicants to become one of the 14 talented candidates in the IT Division of Techcombank, rotating through various positions. In my first role as a <strong>Business Analyst</strong>, I participated in the <strong>Auto Earning</strong> project, which allowed customers' idle money to generate interest, leading Techcombank to the top position in <strong>CASA (Current Account and Savings Account)</strong> for the first time.</p>

<p>This project was essentially an application of my previous research on <strong>asset allocation</strong>, aiming for high returns with low risk while accommodating the uncertainty of when customers would need their funds, ensuring no liquidity risk for the customers.</p>

<p>My major at <a href="https://hust.edu.vn/" target="_blank">Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST)</a> is <strong>Mathematics – Informatics</strong>. I have always been curious about <strong>Applied Mathematics</strong>, especially <strong>discrete and continuous Optimization</strong>.</p>

<p>During my university years, I focused on researching mathematical problems applied to economics. My thesis was regarding <strong>bi-level optimization and its application in Economics</strong>. I deployed a <strong>MATLAB</strong> program to allocate investment assets among different stocks in the Vietnamese market.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I achieved the highest results in the <strong>Applied Mathematics Committee</strong> and became the only student in my cohort that year to present at the <strong>21st Workshop on Optimization and Scientific Computing</strong> in 2023.</p>

<p>Additionally, I had a two-month research internship at the <strong>Institute of Mathematics and Informatics, Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology (VAST)</strong> – the biggest governmental life science research institution in Vietnam. During those times, I worked on a collaborative problem involving multi-parties and different business growths, which led to significant results and was presented at the <strong>VAST annual conference</strong>.</p>
